# requirements
Create the cover of a newspaper (main page) trying not to copy any particular newspaper but to put together your own cover design using FlexBox as the main tool for creating a Responsive Design following the Mobile First concept. The cover must contain the name of the newspaper, date, main news with images, title, brief description and link to the news, secondary news with or without image and only the title and link to the news, a navigation menu to the different sections of the newspaper and advertisements. It is not necessary that the links of the news, advertisements or navigation menu lead anywhere, it is only necessary that the cover is complete, functional and displayed correctly on any device. The main menu should be a horizontal bar with links when viewed from a desktop PC, but when looking at the web from a cell phone the horizontal bar should disappear and only the “hamburger” icon should be displayed ☰ (it is not necessary to do it click for now since that is solved with JavaScript).
The layout of the journal must comply with the following Layout Design format and the result must be uploaded to a new repository on Github.
